// Attack 6 — rollback / replay. KNOWN GAP, asserted so the limitation is

//
// Each fragment is signed independently with no monotonic version bound into the
// signed content. So an attacker who possesses an OLDER, more-permissive but
// still validly-signed version of a fragment (e.g. one the operator later
// tightened) can substitute it, and it verifies cleanly — node-agent has no way
// to know it was superseded. This test documents that today the rollback is
// ACCEPTED. Closing it requires a monotonic version/nonce inside the signed
// content (and rejecting a lower version than last seen). See the design notes
// on trust-policy hardening + fragment versioning.
// TestAdversarial_RollbackReplay_GuardedByVersion documents WHERE the rollback
// defense lives. AssembleAndVerify is deliberately STATELESS: an older,
// validly-signed fragment still verifies and assembles here, because a signature
// alone cannot report that it has been superseded. The monotonic guard is one
// layer up, in the cache (checkAndAdvanceVersions), keyed on LeafRef.Version —
// which admitFragment parses from the SIGNED labels (LabelVersion). This test
// pins that the signed version reaches the leaf, so the cache guard has an
// unforgeable value to enforce against its per-slot high-water-mark.
